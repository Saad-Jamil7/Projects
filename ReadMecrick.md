# Cricket Stats Data Visualization 📊🏏

A beginner-friendly data visualization project exploring international cricket statistics using **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

**Project Highlights:**

* Loaded and cleaned cricket datasets for batsmen, bowlers, and all-rounders across Test, ODI, and T20I formats.
* Explored player performance trends and top performers in each format.
* Created insightful visualizations: line plots for year-by-year consistency, scatter plots for average vs strike rate, pie charts for milestone counts, and bar charts for total runs.
* Learned key data science skills: data manipulation, reshaping with `melt()`, statistical analysis with NumPy, and effective data storytelling.

**Next Steps / Future Work:**

* Comparative analysis across formats.
* Bowler analytics and all-rounder performance studies.
* Interactive dashboards with Plotly Dash or Streamlit.
* Predictive modeling using statistics and **Scikit-learn**.

**Skills Applied:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis.
